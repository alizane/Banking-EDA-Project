Banking Customer Exploratory Data Analysis & Dashboard
Project Duration: Aug 2025

üìä Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a banking dataset. The primary goal is to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior and transaction patterns. The complete workflow spans from initial data cleaning and processing to in-depth statistical analysis, and culminates in an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for strategic decision-making by stakeholders.
